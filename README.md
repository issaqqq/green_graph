# green_graph

Here we will manipulate Github Contribution Graph !

Green Graph is a Node.js-based GitHub repository tool designed to generate artificial commits on any specified dates and frequencies, helping users fill their contribution graph with "green" squares. 
It stores commit data and configurations in JSON files for simplicity and persistence. 
Users can customize time frames, commit counts per day, and even skip weekends via command-line options.
